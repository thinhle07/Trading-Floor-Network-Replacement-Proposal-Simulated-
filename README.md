# Trading-Floor-Network-Replacement-Proposal-Simulated-
This repository contains the design and proposal for a simulated network infrastructure upgrade for a financial trading floor, addressing critical performance, availability, and security requirements.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a simulated network design to replace an outdated trading floor network. The goal was to create a future-proof network that meets stringent demands for:

* **High Performance:** Transaction completion within <1ms.
* **High Availability:** 99.999% uptime for the trading floor.
* **Robust Security:** Comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive data.
* **Scalability:** Ability to support future growth and technological advancements.

This project was simulated using Packet Tracer.

## Key Features

* **High Availability Design:** Implemented redundant pathways and OSPF routing to achieve a projected 99.999% uptime.
* **VLAN Segmentation:** Configured and documented VLANs to segment network traffic for 6 distinct departments, enhancing security and efficiency.
* **OSPF Routing:** Implemented OSPF across a simulated multi-site WAN to optimize routing and reduce path selection time.
* **Security Implementation:** Simulated firewall and DMZ configurations to reduce potential external attack vectors.
* **Low-Latency Design:** Designed for transaction completion within <1ms in the simulated trading floor environment.
* **IPv6 Addressing:** Developed a comprehensive IPv6 addressing scheme to support future scalability.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Included network diagrams, addressing schemes, and configuration plans.

## Technologies Used

* Packet Tracer (Network Simulation)
* IPv6
* OSPF
* VLANs
* Firewalls
* DMZ

## Getting Started

1.  **Packet Tracer:** You will need Packet Tracer to open diagram file.
2.  **Explore the Diagram:** Open the `Network_Diagram.pkt` in Packet Tracer to explore the network design.
